1. I have very little coding experience in JavaScript. Over the summer I did majority of CodeCademy's JavaScript course. 

2. I wanted to take this class because I wanted to see if I enjoy computer science and try something that I've never doen before. 

3. My other academic interests are mainly in math, but this year I am taking economics which is really interesting. 

4. I don't have any set goals yet, but I'm sure as I gain more knowledge in computer science I will think of projects that interest me.
